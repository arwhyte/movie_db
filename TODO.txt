TODO:
-Style film_detail.html
-Style login mpage (login.html)
-Add not just build, but populate script to the mysql database generation code, see if you can find this in one of the earlier exercize documents
-Be sure to note that new_title.html takes a few minutes to load
-Rebuild the database and reimport tables, we had to make an edit to actor_lookup table (originally forgot to make it autoincrement). This needs to happen for the add film functionality to work
-Add requirements.txt

See
