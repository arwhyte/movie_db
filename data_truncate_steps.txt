1. TITLE: title_basics.tsv, sort descending by 'startYear' and take the first 5000 records, get rid of the rest DONE.

2. LOOKUP TABLES: Bring in the new title output file, pull out list of title ids as a series
3. Flatten name_basics.tsv so that there's one column for "knownForTitles"
4. Filter the new dataframe so that only the title ids that appear in step2 are included
5. Cut the new lookup tables based on the filtered 'knownForTitles'

6. ACTOR, WRITER, DIRECTOR: Similar to lookup tables, filter the dataframe on those top 5000 titles DONE.

7. BACK TO LOOKUP TABLES
-limit them to the actors, directors, and writers in the actor, writer, director tables. Otherwise data import will fail
